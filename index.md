*Note: The first two class sessions (9/9, 9/16) will be both in person and on Zoom to accommodate both enrolled and waitlisted attendees. From 9/23, the lectures will only be in person and we expect everyone to attend in person.*


## ~ Welcome from Jitendra ~

Robotics has been late to the deep learning revolution compared to computer vision and natural
language processing, mainly because "big data" is not so readily available. However significant
advances have been made in the last few years, and the purpose of this class is to present a
coherent framework for studying these advances.

My goal is to build machines that can emulate the remarkable capabilities of humans and other
animals at motor control, defined as connecting perception to action in the physical world. Hence
there will be a distinct preference for legs over wheels, multi-finger hands over parallel jaw
grippers, rich visual and tactile perception over minimal sensing, humanoid robots in the home
over specialist robots on the factory floor. The course itself will have three main parts (1)
biological motor control basics for inspiration (2) main paradigms for robot motor skill
acquisition (3) case studies of locomotion, navigation and manipulation.

### Prerequisites
This is a graduate level class, and prerequisite knowledge at the level of Deep Learning (Bishop
& Bishop), and Reinforcement Learning (Sutton & Barto) will be assumed.

**Class enrollment is capped at 45. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Ue1Vnsc9asUhDXR-cOjPxOLiELoEtKu0GEJUaW3q4M/edit?usp=sharing) is a list of self-evaluation questions for interested students to see whether they are ready for the class.**

## Course Format

Each session consists of a two 1-hour lectures with a 10 minute break in between, i.e. 3:10-4 PM and 4:10-5PM. We will use notations A/B to denote the sub-sessions: e.g. Lecture 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, ...

## Schedule

The following schedule is a tentative assignment and will evolve in real time. Weekly materials will be added.

## Coursework

- 10% Weekly Reading Assignment
- 10% Lecture Scribing
- 30% Midterm
- 50% Final Project

**Weekly Reading Assignment**: For every weekly reading, each student should come up with 2 multiple choice questions, and supply with answers. We will send out a Google form for submission each week.

**Lecture Scribing**: For each lecture, two student scribes will organize lecture notes in LaTeX. The students can decide to submit a single note together or individually; grades will be assigned based on note quality. The lecture notes should be ready by the same Friday. Sign-up sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TQzGYdRPp4Wtx0MXxJ19brMyj-wWIv6f1JznIZG42Lk/edit?usp=sharing).

**Midterm**: About two-thirds into the semseter we will have a mid-term exam based on questions sourced from the weekly reading assignments. One 8.5”x11”, double-sided cheat sheet will be permitted.

**Final Project**: Can be done in a group of 1-4. More details to come.


### ❗Assignment Deadlines
- Weekly Reading: 23:59PM PT, the Friday after assignment release
- Lecture Scribing: 23:59PM PT, the Friday after scribed lecture
