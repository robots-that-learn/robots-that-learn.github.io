CS 294-277, Robots That Learn (Fall 2024)

# Logistics

UC Berkeley (CN:34334)
Time: Mondays 3-5 pm
Location: 1203 Berkeley Way West
Instructor: [Jitendra Malik](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik)
TA: [Toru Lin](https://toruowo.github.io/)


## Introduction from Jitendra

Robotics has been late to the deep learning revolution compared to computer vision and natural
language processing, mainly because ”big data” is not so readily available. However significant
advances have been made in the last few years, and the purpose of this class is to present a
coherent framework for studying these advances.

My goal is to build machines that can emulate the remarkable capabilities of humans and other
animals at motor control, defined as connecting perception to action in the physical world. Hence
there will be a distinct preference for legs over wheels, multi-finger hands over parallel jaw
grippers, rich visual and tactile perception over minimal sensing, humanoid robots in the home
over specialist robots on the factory floor. The course itself will have three main parts (1)
biological motor control basics for inspiration (2) main paradigms for robot motor skill
acquisition (3) case studies of locomotion, navigation and manipulation.

This is a graduate level class, and prerequisite knowledge at the level of Deep Learning (Bishop
& Bishop), and Reinforcement Learning (Sutton & Barto) will be assumed.
